## Languages and Functions
This exercise was done in the Ubuntu enviroment using [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) with the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) packages. This exercise can be easily done using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb), like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Remember that you can use any language that you are more familiar with to plot the simulations, like R, MATLAB, Octave and others. If you and your colleges have any doubts about the instalation of this technologies, reach the monitors or read the documentations.
