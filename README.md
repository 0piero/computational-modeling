# Computational Modeling

This repository was created towards the Computational Modeling course of the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo.

It should be used by the students to:
- Get tips and tricks for their own projects;
- Execute a complete solution and understand the goals of the exercise;
- Improve your solutions.

## How to use this repository
If you are currently enrolled in the course, **do not copy code in the first place.** It is important that you understand your own difficulties and seek help from monitors and also the professor. **Try to do it by yourself,** making mistakes and learning from them is part of the process.

In this repository, you will find:
- `README.md` files for you to understand the problem and its mathematical concepts;
- `TIPS.md` files to help if you are stuck in any part of the development;
- Sometimes, `FAQ.md` files for when students get stuck in the same problems too often;

Remember that you can also develop your projects with the language you are more used to. In case you still need help with an individual approach, feel free to reach the monitors during the published schedule.

As a *contributor* you can give feedback and propose changes to the code and documentation as you wish.
